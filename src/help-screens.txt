Joyride

This program monitors the controllers connected to your Commodore 64 and displays relevant information. It supports a wide variety of controllers and adapters.

Joyride currently does not work on NTSC machines.

This is Joyride ${VERSION}. The newest version and further information can be found at
   https://github.com/T-Pau/Joyride

To test the keyboard, use the companion program Anykey:
  https://github.com/T-Pau/Anykey

Views

There are three views:

- controller and user ports
- multi adapters 
- special controllers

Use F1/F2 to switch between views.

Use Run/Stop to exit Joyride.

For binary inputs, the button or direction is inverted when pressed. Analog or positional inputs are displayed as numbers and by positioning a cursor.

Controller and User Ports

The top windows display the devices connected to the controller ports, the bottom window displays the device connected to the user port.

Use the function keys to select the correct controller type or to display raw data.
---
Joystick

Joysticks contain a stick or d-pad with switches for the four cardinal directions and up to three buttons.

Buttons 2 and 3 bring an analog potentiometer to a low value by connecting its pin to +5v.

These potentiometers are also used by paddles and the 1351 mouse; if such a device is connected, the buttons may read as pressed.
---
Mouse

Supported are 1351 compatible mice. They give the position in x and y modulo 64 and support up to three buttons and a scroll wheel.
---
Paddle

A paddle gives the rotational position of its knob as a value from 0 to 255. It also contains a button.

Two paddles can be connected to one port at the same time. They are displayed in two separate pages.
---
KoalaPad

This is a touch tablet that gives the position in x and y as values from ca. 6 to 251. It also contains two buttons.
---
Light Pen

Light pens and light guns only work in controller port 1 and require a CRT monitor.

They point directly at a position on screen. This is indicated by a big cross-hair on screen, even if it's outside the display area of the port. It is also shown on a smaller representation of the screen.

They can have up to two buttons. Some pens require a button to be pressed for the position to register.
---
Protovision Protopad

This is a SuperNES style controller that can emulate a regular joystick or all buttons can be read in native mode.

This view displays the native mode. For emulation mode, use the Joystick view.

It has these inputs:
- d-pad
- four face buttons (A, B, X, Y)
- two shoulder buttons (L, R)
- Select, Start

Note: Support for this controller has not been tested with real hardware.
---
Trap Them Controller

This is a SuperNES style controller with these inputs:
- d-pad
- four face buttons (1, 2, 3, 4)

Due to technical limitations, up and down can't be read while fire is pressed.
---
PET Space Invaders+

This adapter is an extension of the Space Invaders adapter designed for the PET, which adds up and down.

It supports one joystick with four directional switches and one button.
---

Note: Support for this adapter has not been tested with real hardware.
---
PETSCII Robots Adapter

This adapter is included with the game Attack of the PETSCII Robots and allows connecting one SuperNES controller or mouse to the user port.

The controller has these inputs:
- d-pad
- four face buttons (A, B, X, Y)
- two shoulder buttons (L, R)
- Select, Start

Mice display x/y and two buttons.
---
Multi Adapters

These adapters support 4 to 16 input devices. The type of devices depends on the adapter.

They connect to the user port, controller ports, or both.

Four controllers are displayed per page, from left to right, top to bottom. 

Use F3/F4 to switch adapters and F5/F6 to switch pages.
---
SuperPAD 64 / Ninja SNES Pad

---
Special Controllers

These devices don't fit in the regular controller port window or block parts of the keyboard and are therefore collected in a separate view.

While they work in both controller ports, Joyride only supports them in port 1.

Use F3/F4 to switch controller type. 

For keypads, previously pressed keys are displayed in a lighter gray to help detect dead keys. To reset the state of all keys, press F5. 
---
