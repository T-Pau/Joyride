Joyride

This program monitors the controllers connected to your Commodore 64 and displays relevant information. It supports a wide variety of controllers and adapters.

This is Joyride ${VERSION}. The newest version and further information can be found at
   https://github.com/T-Pau/Joyride

To test the keyboard, use the companion program Anykey:

Joyride

The top windows display the devices connected to the controller ports, the bottom window displays the device connected to the user port.

You can use the function keys to select the correct controller type or to display raw data.

Adapters that support more than two controllers don't fit in the main screen. F7 switches to a layout that supports four controllers per page.

For digital inputs, the button or direction is inverted when pressed. Analog inputs are displayed as numbers and by positioning a cursor.

Joystick

Joysticks contain a stick or d-pad with switches for the four cardinal directions and up to three buttons.

Buttons 2 and 3 bring an analog potentiometer to a low value by connecting its pin to +5v.

These potentiometers are also used by paddles and the 1351 mouse; if such a device is connected, the buttons may read as pressed.
---
Mouse

Supported are 1351 compatible mice. They give the position in x and y modulo 64 and support up to three buttons and a scroll wheel.
---
Paddle

A paddle gives the rotational position of its knob as a value from 0 to 255. It also contains a button.

Two paddles can be connected to one port at the same time. They are displayed in two separate pages.
---
Koalapad

This is a touch tablet that gives the position in x and y as values from ca. 6 to 251. It also contains two buttons.
---
Light Pen

Light pens and light guns only work in controller port 1 and require a CRT monitor to work.

They point directly at a position on screen. This is indicated by a big cross hair on screen, even if it's outside the display area of the port. It is also shown on a smaller representation of the screen.

They can have up to two buttons. Some pens require a button to be pressed for the position to register.
