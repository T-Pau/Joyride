Inception HW and firmware info
------------------------------

WTF ?
-----
Inception is based on a 8-bit HCS08 family microcontroller unit (MCU) 
from Freescale, namely MC9S08LG32CLK. It features:

    - 40 MHz core
    - 1.9 kB RAM
    - 32 kB internal flash
    - similar instruction set to 6510 CPU


Schematics
----------
Inception is a simple piece of HW, basically all IO's are connected directly to the CPU with external
pull'up resistors. On board a 32.768 crystal is used for precision timing. Each JOY fire has a LED 
diode connected, which can be triggered by the CPU or by pressing FIRE on a proper joystick. From 
the C64 side an electrostatic discharge (ESD) and voltage rail protection is placed. That's 
basically all :)
